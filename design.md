## Secrets management

- `Generic File Storage` is not used.
- Secrets are set using `App Environment Variables` which are available in pull requests. 
  Only private repos with trusted committers should use the Firebase Test Lab step.
- Optionally `Secret Environment Variables` may be used however they will not be available
  on pull request builds.
